1. Ancient Civilizations
Mesopotamia and Egypt (c. 3500–3000 BCE): Some of the earliest forms of formal education were found in these ancient civilizations. In Mesopotamia, schools known as "edubbas" taught the sons of nobles how to read and write cuneiform, the script used at the time. Egyptian temples also trained scribes, priests, and bureaucrats in hieroglyphics and religious teachings.

Ancient India and China: In ancient India, schools (called gurukuls) existed where students lived with their teacher (guru) to learn various subjects, including religious texts, mathematics, and philosophy. In ancient China, Confucian schools emerged, where the focus was on moral values, ethics, and civil service exams.

Ancient Greece (c. 500 BCE): The concept of paideia was central to Greek education, which emphasized well-rounded development. Philosophers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle established systems of thought that influenced Western education. Plato founded The Academy, one of the first institutions of higher learning in the Western world. Aristotle's Lyceum was another prominent center for learning.

Ancient Rome: Roman education borrowed heavily from the Greeks. Wealthy families would send their sons to schools or hire private tutors. Subjects included Latin, rhetoric, and philosophy, with an emphasis on preparing boys for public life or military service.

2. Middle Ages
Monastic Schools (c. 500–1000 CE): After the fall of the Roman Empire, much of Europe's formal education was preserved and provided by the Christian Church. Monasteries became the primary centers of learning, where monks copied ancient texts and taught subjects like theology, philosophy, and the classics.

Madrasahs and Islamic Golden Age: During the Islamic Golden Age (8th to 14th centuries), madrasahs (Islamic schools) were established across the Muslim world. Centers of learning like Baghdad's House of Wisdom became famous for advancements in mathematics, astronomy, medicine, and philosophy. Scholars translated Greek and Roman texts, contributing to the preservation of ancient knowledge.

Universities: The first universities were established in Europe during the 11th and 12th centuries. The University of Bologna (founded in 1088) and the University of Paris (1150) were among the earliest. These institutions were initially focused on religious education but expanded to include philosophy, law, and medicine.
